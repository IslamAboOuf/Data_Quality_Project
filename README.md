# Data Quality App

This is a Python-based web application built using
**Streamlit** for performing common data quality tasks such as handling missing values, duplicates,
and outliers in datasets, The app also integrates with **Ollama** for a chatbot
interface to interact with the dataset and answer questions using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** model.

## Features

### 1. Data Quality Tasks:
- Handle missing values by filling, dropping, or flagging them.
- Identify and remove duplicate records.
- Detect and treat outliers using statistical methods
 
### 2. Chatbot Integration:
- Leverages the **Ollama** platform for interacting with datasets.
- Uses **RAG** to provide intelligent answers and insights based on the dataset.

### 3. User-Friendly Interface:
- Built with **Streamlit**, providing an intuitive and interactive web UI.


## Usage
- **Upload Dataset:** Upload your CSV dataset through the interface.
- **Perform Data Quality Checks:**
    -Handle missing values and duplicates.
    -Detect and manage outliers.
- **Interact with Chatbot:** Use the chatbot to ask questions about your dataset or get recommendations.
